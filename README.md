AD 699 - Data Mining Semester Project
Team: Charlie’s Angels
Project Overview
This project delves into Airbnb listing data, focusing on data preprocessing, exploration, and analysis. Our team, Charlie’s Angels, conducted a comprehensive study to understand the pricing dynamics and other crucial aspects of Airbnb listings.

Key Components:
Data Preparation & Exploration: Techniques for handling missing values, and exploratory analysis of key variables like price and bed count.
Prediction & Modeling: Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Naive Bayes models for predicting various aspects of Airbnb listings.
Data Visualization & Mapping: Insights gained from histograms, boxplots, violin plots, and mapping using different visualization tools.
Classification & Clustering: Usage of classification trees and cluster analysis to understand the dynamics of Airbnb listings.
Final Insights: Providing valuable insights for Airbnb hosts, property managers, and policymakers.
Technologies Used:
R Programming Language
Various data mining and visualization packages
This repository contains our comprehensive analysis, data files, and scripts used for the project.
